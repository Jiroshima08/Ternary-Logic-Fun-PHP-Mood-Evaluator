# 💘 Ternary Logic Fun – PHP Mood & Simpness Evaluator

A lighthearted and humorous PHP web application that evaluates your *"simpness level"* based on your current mood. Whether you're mildly delulu or already imagining the wedding, this playful tool responds with customized advice, reactions, and tips — all while demonstrating key PHP concepts.

This project showcases the use of core **PHP control structures**, including **conditionals**, **loops**, **arrays**, and — of course — the **ternary operator** to deliver interactive and fun responses.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`)** – Determines the user’s mood level and generates witty responses.
- **Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)** – Renders simp level rankings and heart icons dynamically.
- **`foreach` Loop** – Iterates through an array of motivational and sometimes chaotic advice.
- **Ternary Operator** – Used to conditionally display bonus tips based on the user’s selection.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user inputs a mood level (1–10) and chooses whether they want a *rizz* tip.
2. The app dynamically ranks their simpness from 1 up to the selected level.
3. Personalized feedback, love advice, and bonus content are displayed depending on their input.
